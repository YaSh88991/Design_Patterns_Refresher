# Design Patterns in C++ — A Practical Refresher

This repo provides a practical and concise reference to essential object-oriented design patterns in C++.  
Each pattern is presented with a clear explanation of the problem it solves, its class structure, a real-world analogy, usage guidelines, and idiomatic C++ code examples.

## What Are Design Patterns?

**Design patterns** are general, proven solutions to common problems encountered in software design.  
They represent best practices refined by experienced developers and help make code more flexible, maintainable, and understandable by offering standardized approaches to recurring challenges.

---

## Why Use Design Patterns?

- **Enhance code clarity:** Patterns provide a clear structure and intent, making complex systems easier to understand and maintain.
- **Improve reusability:** Well-designed patterns facilitate code reuse across projects and teams.
- **Facilitate collaboration:** Shared vocabulary allows teams to communicate solutions more efficiently.
- **Support scalability and flexibility:** Patterns help organize code that can adapt to changing requirements with minimal modification.

## Prerequisites

To get the most from this repository, you should be comfortable with:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** classes, inheritance, composition, encapsulation
- **C++ Fundamentals:** constructors, destructors, access control, pointers/references, virtual functions
- **Basic Polymorphism:** interfaces, abstract classes, overriding, dynamic dispatch
- **Familiarity with SOLID Principles** (recommended)

## Patterns Included

The repository covers several core design patterns from each of the classic categories:

### Creational
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder

### Structural
- Adapter
- Decorator
- Facade
- Proxy
- Composite

### Behavioral
- Strategy
- Observer
- Command
- Template Method
- State

For each pattern, you will find:
- The problem it addresses
- Class structure (UML or text explanation)
- A real-world analogy or use-case
- Benefits and guidelines for use
- C++ code example(s)
