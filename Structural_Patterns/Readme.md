# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects, defining clear and efficient ways to build larger, more flexible systems from smaller parts.  
They help manage complexity by structuring relationships between components, supporting adaptability, scalability, and maintainability in your software architecture.

## What Are Structural Patterns?

Structural patterns describe how to organize and connect objects or classes to create bigger, more feature-rich structures—without making the system rigid or tightly coupled.  
They allow you to:
- Combine and compose objects for new functionality
- Adapt interfaces so components work together (even if not originally designed to)
- Simplify complex subsystems behind simple, unified interfaces
- Represent part-whole hierarchies (e.g., trees, composites)
- Control access, add features, or manage resource sharing among components

## Benefits

- **Promote code reuse** through flexible object/class composition
- **Reduce complexity** by abstracting and simplifying object relationships
- **Enable easy extension** as system requirements evolve
- **Encourage loose coupling** between system components

---

## Common Structural Patterns

- **Adapter:** Make incompatible interfaces work together
- **Decorator:** Dynamically add features to objects
- **Facade:** Simplify a complex system with a unified interface
- **Composite:** Treat groups and single objects uniformly (e.g., posts with nested comments)
- **Proxy:** Control access or add extra behavior to objects
- **Bridge, Flyweight:** Further patterns for advanced resource sharing or decoupling

## When to Use Structural Patterns

- When your system is growing in size or complexity and needs organized relationships between components
- When you want to extend or enhance functionality without changing existing code
- When simplifying or unifying interfaces to subsystems is valuable
- When you need to adapt or integrate components with different interfaces
